 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.   And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.    And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.   But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.   (1 Corinthians 12:4-7)
