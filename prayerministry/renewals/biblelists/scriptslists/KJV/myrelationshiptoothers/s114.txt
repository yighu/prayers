But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth  bountifully shall reap also  bountifully.  Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not  grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.  And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:  (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.   Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)   (2 Corinthians 9:6-10)
