  And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,   And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be  one flesh?  Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.  But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;   And they twain shall be  one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.  What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.   (Matthew 19:4-6; Mark 10:6-9)
