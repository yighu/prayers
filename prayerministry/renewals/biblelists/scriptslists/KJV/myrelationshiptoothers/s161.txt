   Owe no man any thing,  but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.    For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  
 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.   (Romans 13:8-10)
