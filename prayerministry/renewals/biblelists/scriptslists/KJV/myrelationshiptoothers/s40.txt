 ¶ Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.   ¶ Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.   (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16)
