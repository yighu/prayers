Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;  Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;  With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:  Knowing that whatsoever  good thing  any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.   (Ephesians 6:5-8)
