 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;   Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.    For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:   (1 Peter 2:13-15)
