Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.  For we have not an high priest which can not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted  like as we are, yet without sin.  Let us therefore come bold ly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.   (Hebrews 4:14-16)
