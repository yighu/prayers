Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth  him also that is begotten of him.   For whatsoever  is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.   Who is he that overcometh the world, but  he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?     (1 John 5:1, 4-5)
