And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.   Herein  is our  love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.  There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.      (1 John 4:16-18)
