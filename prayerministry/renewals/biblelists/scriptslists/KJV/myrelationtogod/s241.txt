To the chief Musician, Al–taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.  I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.   (Psalm 57:1-2)
