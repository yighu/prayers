But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Â But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.   (Isaiah 64:6, 8)
