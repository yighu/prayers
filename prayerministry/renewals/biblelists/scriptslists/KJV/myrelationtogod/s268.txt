And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,  Whosoever  committeth sin is the servant of sin.  And  the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth  ever.  If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.   (John 8:32, 34-36)
