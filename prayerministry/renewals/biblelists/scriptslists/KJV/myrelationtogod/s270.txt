My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:   And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.      My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.   (John 10:27-29)
