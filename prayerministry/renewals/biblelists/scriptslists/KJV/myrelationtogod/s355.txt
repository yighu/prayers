  Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. Â But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead  wherein  we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.   (Romans 7:4, 6)
