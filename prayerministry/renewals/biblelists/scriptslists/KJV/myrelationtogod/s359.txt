   And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. Â      But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by  his  Spirit  that dwelleth in you.   (Romans 8:10-11)
