For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. Â I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.    (Galatians 2:19-20)
