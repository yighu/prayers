In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Â Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.   (Ephesians 1:13-14)
