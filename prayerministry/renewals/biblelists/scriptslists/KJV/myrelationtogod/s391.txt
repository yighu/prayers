But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.  Yea doubtless, and I count all things but  loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,    And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:   (Philippians 3:7-9)
