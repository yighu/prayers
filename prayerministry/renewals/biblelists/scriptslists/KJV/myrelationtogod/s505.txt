But  he that received the seed into  stony places, the same is  he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.   He also that received seed among the thorns is he  that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.  But  he that received seed into the  good ground is he  that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth,  some an hundredfold,  some sixty,  some thirty.  And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;    And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.  And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,    And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.    And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some  thirtyfold, some  sixty, and some  an hundred.     They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.  And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.   But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.   (Matthew 13:20-23; Mark 4:16-20; Luke  8:13-15)
