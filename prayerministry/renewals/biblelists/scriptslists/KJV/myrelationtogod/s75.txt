A Song of degrees.Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. Â Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.   (Psalm 123:1-2)
