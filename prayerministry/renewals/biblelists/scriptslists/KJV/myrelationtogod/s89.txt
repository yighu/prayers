 ¶ Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:     For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.     For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.   (Matthew 7:7-8; Luke 11:9-10)
