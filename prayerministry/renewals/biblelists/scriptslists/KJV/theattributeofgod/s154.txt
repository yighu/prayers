He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. Â The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.   (1 Samuel 2:9-10)
