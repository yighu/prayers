Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.  Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.  How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.  For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.   (Psalm 36:5-7, 9)
