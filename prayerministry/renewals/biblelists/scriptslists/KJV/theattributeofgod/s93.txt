For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.  For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.  Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.  Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.  Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.   (Psalm 96:4-8)
