 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.  But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.  For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:  But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.   For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.   (2 Corinthians 10:12-14, 17-18)
