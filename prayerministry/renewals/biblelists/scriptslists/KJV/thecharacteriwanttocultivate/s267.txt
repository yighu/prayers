 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God  cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:   But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.   Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.   (James 1:13-15)
