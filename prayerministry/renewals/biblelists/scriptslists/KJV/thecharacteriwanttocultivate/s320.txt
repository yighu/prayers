 For every kind of beasts,  and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:    But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.   Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and  therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.   Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.   (James 3:7-10)
