Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.  Â Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.   (Philippians 4:8-9)
