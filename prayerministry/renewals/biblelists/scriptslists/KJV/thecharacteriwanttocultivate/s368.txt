 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.  But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.  This wisdom  descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.  For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.   (James 3:13-16)
