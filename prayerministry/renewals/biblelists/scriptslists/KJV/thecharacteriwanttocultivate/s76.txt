A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;  Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;   One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;      Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.   (1 Timothy 3:2-4, 7)
