 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:    Whereby  the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:     But the heavens and the earth,  which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.   (2 Peter 3:5-7)
