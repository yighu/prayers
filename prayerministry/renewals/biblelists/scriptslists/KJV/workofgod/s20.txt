And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.    And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.  Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.   (Mark 13:26-27, 33)
