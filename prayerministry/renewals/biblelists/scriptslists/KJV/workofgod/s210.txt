 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.  Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.  And blessed is he, whosoever shall  not be offended in me.   (Luke 7:21-23)
