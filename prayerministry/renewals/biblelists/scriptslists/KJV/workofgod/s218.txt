Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?  And beginning at Moses and  all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.  And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.   (Luke 24:26-27, 44)
