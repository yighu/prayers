Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.  But he spake of the temple of his body.  When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.   (John 2:19, 21-22)
