But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.  To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.   And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.   And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.    This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.  Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.   All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.  I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.    I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.     As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.   (John 10:2-8, 11, 14-15)
