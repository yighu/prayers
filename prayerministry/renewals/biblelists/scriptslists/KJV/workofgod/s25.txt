  Verily, verily, I say unto you,  The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.  For as the Father hath life in himself; so  hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;  And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.   (John 5:25-27)
