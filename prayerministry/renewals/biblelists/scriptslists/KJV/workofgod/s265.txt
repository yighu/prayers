 And  the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: Â Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.   (Acts 17:30-31)
