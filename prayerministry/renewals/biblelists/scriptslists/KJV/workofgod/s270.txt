    Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein  thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. Â   But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.   (Romans 2:1-2)
