For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.   For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.  
 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.   (Romans 5:6-8)
