     For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)  Therefore  as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.      For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so  by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.   (Romans 5:17-19)
