  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.     But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;   And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:  That no  flesh should glory in his presence.   (1 Corinthians 1:25, 27-29)
