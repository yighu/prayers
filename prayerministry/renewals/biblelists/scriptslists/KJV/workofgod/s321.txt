Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;    Â And deliver them who through fear of death were  all their lifetime subject to bondage.   (Hebrews 2:14-15)
