Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.   Â For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.    (Hebrews 2:17-18)
