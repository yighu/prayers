By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   And  every priest standeth   daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:   But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;   From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.     For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.     (Hebrews 10:10-14)
