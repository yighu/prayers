Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Â   But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar  people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:   (1 Peter 2:5, 9)
