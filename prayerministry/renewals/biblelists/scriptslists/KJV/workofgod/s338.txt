And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,     Â And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.   (Revelation 1:5-6)
