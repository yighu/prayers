But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein  shall be burned up. Â  Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God,  wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?   (2 Peter 3:10, 12)
