 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:      For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:   And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.   (Colossians 1:15-17)
