 ¶ And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.  And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.   (Genesis 2:18, 22-24)
