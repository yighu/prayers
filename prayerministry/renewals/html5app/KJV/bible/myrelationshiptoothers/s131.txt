 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.   Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ,  so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.   (Ephesians 5:22-24)
