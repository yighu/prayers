  Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  This is the first and great commandment.   And the second is like unto it,  Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.   On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.   (Matthew 22:37-40)
