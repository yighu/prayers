For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.  We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.   Hereby  perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.   (1 John 3:11, 14, 16)
