But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.  And he gave some,  apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;   For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:   (Ephesians 4:7, 11-12)
