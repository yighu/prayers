 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:  That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and  cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;   But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:   (Ephesians 4:13-15)
