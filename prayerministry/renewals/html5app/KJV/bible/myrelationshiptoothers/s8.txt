God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Â    Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.   (1 Corinthians 1:9-10)
