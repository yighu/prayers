 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:     And what soever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;   Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.   (Colossians 3:22-24)
