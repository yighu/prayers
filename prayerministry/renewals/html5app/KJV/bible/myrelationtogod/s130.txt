This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not  fulfil the lust of the flesh.  For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that  ye would.    But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.   (Galatians 5:16-18)
