 ¶ Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.  For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.   (Isaiah 41:10, 13)
