Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,  Except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,  Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdom of God.    That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.   The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.   (John 3:3, 5-6, 8)
