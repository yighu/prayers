All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and  him that cometh to me I will in no wise  cast out.  For I came down from heaven, not to do  mine own will, but the will  of him that sent me.  And this is the Father's will  which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing,  but should raise it up again at  the last day.  And this is the will  of him that sent me, that every one  which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up  at the last day.   (John 6:37-40)
