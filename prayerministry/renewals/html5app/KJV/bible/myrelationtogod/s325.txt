  For which cause we faint not; but though  our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.   For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us  a far  more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;  While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.   (2 Corinthians 4:16-18)
