These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.  But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed  to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.  Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.    (Hebrews 11:13, 16, 26)
