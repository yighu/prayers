In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: Â    Buried with him in baptism, where in also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.   (Colossians 2:11-12)
