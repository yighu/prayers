And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;   That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;    Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.   (Philippians 1:9-11)
