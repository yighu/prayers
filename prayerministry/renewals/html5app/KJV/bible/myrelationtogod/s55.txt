  For we wrestle not  against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Â  Wherefore  take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.   (Ephesians 6:12-13)
