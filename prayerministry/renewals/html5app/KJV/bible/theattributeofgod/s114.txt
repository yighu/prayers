 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.     And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.   (Matthew 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke 3:22)
