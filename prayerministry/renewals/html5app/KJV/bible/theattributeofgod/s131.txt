 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Â Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else  believe me for the very works' sake.   (John 14:10-11)
