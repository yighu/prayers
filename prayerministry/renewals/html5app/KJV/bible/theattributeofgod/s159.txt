For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.  For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.  Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.  Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.  Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.   (1 Chronicles 16:25-29)
