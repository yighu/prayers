Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him?  With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?  Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.  All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.   ¶ To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?   (Isaiah 40:13-15, 17-18)
