Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might. Â Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.   (Jeremiah 10:6-7)
