I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.  I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.  Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.  LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.  My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.  I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.   (Psalm 119:162-163, 165-168)
