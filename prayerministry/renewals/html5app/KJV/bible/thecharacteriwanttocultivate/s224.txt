My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  And hereby  we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.  For if our heart  condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.  Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.  And whatsoever  we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.    (1 John 3:18-22)
