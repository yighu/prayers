For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.     Â Now  no  chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised there by.     (Hebrews 12:10-11)
