Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! Â  And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.   (James 3:5-6)
