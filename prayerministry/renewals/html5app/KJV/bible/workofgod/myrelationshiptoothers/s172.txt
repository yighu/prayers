Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. Â  There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?   (James 4:11-12)
