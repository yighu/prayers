  Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Â Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.    Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.   (Matthew 9:37-38; Luke 10:2)
