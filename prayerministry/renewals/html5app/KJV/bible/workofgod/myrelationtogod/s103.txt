Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except  ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.   Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up  at the last day.  For my  flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.   He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.  As  the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so  he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.   (John 6:53-57)
