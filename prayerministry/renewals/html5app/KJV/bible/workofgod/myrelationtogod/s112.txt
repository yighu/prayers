 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.   Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.  Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch  cannot bear fruit of itself, except  it abide in the vine;  no more can ye, except  ye abide in me.   (John 15:1-2, 4)
