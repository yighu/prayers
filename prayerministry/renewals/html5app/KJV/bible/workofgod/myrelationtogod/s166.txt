To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.  For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.  Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.   (Psalm 31:1, 3, 5)
