And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;    Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;   And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.   (Colossians 2:13-15)
