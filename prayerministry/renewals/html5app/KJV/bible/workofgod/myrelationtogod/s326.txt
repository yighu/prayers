 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.   For  in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:  If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.    For  we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality  might be swallowed up of life.  Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.   (2 Corinthians 5:1-5)
