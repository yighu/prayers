But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever  will be great among you, let him be your minister;  And whosoever  will be chief among you, let him be your servant:  But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever  will be great among you, shall be your minister:  And whosoever  of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.   (Matthew 20:26-27; Mark 10:43-44)
