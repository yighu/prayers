 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, Â To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,   (1 Peter 1:3-4)
