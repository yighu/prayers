 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you. Â  For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.     (2 Corinthians 13:3-4)
