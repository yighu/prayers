 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.  If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.   These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.   (John 15:9-11)
