 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened;  that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,   And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,   (Ephesians 1:17-19)
