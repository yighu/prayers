  That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;  That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,   May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;   And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.   (Ephesians 3:16-19)
