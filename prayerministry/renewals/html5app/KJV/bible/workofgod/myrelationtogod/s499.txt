And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, Â And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.   (2 Chronicles 33:12-13)
