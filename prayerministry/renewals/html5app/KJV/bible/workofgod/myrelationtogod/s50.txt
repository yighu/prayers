  Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Â Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.   (Romans 6:12-13)
