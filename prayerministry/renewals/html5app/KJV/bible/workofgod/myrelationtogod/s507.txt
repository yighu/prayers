 ¶ And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?   Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:  
He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.   (Luke 6:46-48)
