Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;  And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;    Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith  ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.   And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:   Praying   always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching   thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;   (Ephesians 6:14-18)
