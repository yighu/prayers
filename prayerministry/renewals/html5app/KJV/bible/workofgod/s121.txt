Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.  And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.  So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.   (Genesis 45:5, 7-8)
