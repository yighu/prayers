With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.  With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.  And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.   (2 Samuel 22:26-28)
