For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Â And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.   (Matthew 24:27, 30)
