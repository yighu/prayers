 ¶ And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.  And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;     For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.   (Matthew 26:26-28)
