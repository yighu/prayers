 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles: Â  And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.   (Mark 10:33-34)
