 ¶ And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.  And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.    And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.   (Mark 14:22-24)
