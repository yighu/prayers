And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;   To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,   Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,   To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.   (Luke 1:76-79)
