If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.   ¶  There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.  Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.  But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.   He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.   ¶  But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same  works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.   And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.  And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.   ¶  Search  the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.   (John 5:31-39)
