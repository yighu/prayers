And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:   But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:   Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.   (Luke 20:34-36)
