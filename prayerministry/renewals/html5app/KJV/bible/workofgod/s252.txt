 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. Â  Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.   (John 17:15, 24)
