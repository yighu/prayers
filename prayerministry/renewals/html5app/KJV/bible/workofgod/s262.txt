The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.   To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.   (Acts 10:36, 42-43)
