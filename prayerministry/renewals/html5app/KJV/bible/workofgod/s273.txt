Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Â  Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.   (Romans 3:19-20)
