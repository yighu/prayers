But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;   Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;   Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:   (Romans 3:21-24)
