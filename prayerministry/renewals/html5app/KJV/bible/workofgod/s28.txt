But why dost thou judge thy brother? or  why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.   For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.  So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.   (Romans 14:10-12)
