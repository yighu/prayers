But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.   Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.   (Galatians 3:23-25)
