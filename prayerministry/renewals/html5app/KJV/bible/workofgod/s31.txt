  The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.    As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.    And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.   (1 Corinthians 15:47-49)
