Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery  to be equal with God:  But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:  And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.   (Philippians 2:5-8)
