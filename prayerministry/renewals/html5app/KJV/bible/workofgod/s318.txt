Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;  In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;   But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;   (Titus 1:1-3)
