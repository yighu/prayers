Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all  sleep, but we shall all be changed,    In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.    For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.   (1 Corinthians 15:51-53)
