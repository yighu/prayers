But we see Jesus, who was made a little  lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.   For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.     (Hebrews 2:9-10)
