Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up  prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;   Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;   Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.   (Hebrews 5:7-10)
