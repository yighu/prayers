For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;  Â Who  needeth not  daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's:  for this he did once, when he offered up himself.    (Hebrews 7:26-27)
