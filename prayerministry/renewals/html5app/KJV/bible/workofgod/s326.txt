But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;   Â Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.      (Hebrews 9:11-12)
