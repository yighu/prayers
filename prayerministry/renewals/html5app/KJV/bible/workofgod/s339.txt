Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Â To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.    (Revelation 3:20-21)
