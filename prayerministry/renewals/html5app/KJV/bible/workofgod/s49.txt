And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.      I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.  He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.   (Revelation 22:12-13, 20)
