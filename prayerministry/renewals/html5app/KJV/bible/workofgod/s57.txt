And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.   (Genesis 2:7, 9, 15)
