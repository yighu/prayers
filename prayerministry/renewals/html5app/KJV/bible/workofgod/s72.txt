For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.  In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.  The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.  For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,   (Psalm 95:3-5, 7)
