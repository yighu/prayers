He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  Â Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.      (John 1:41, 45)
