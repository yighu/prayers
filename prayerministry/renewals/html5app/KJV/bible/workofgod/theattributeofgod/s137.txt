   Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; Â  Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.   (1 Timothy 6:15-16)
