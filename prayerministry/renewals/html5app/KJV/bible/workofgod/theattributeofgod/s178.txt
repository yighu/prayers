The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.  Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.  Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.   (Psalm 93:1-2, 5)
