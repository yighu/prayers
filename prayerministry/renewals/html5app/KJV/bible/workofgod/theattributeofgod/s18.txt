Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?  Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.  Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.  God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.  For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;   (Job 28:20-24)
