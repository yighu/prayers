From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD'S name is to be praised.  The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.  Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,  Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!   (Psalm 113:3-6)
