For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder  of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Â  Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.   (Hebrews 4:12-13)
