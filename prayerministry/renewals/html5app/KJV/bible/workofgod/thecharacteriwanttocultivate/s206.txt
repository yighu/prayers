Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:    Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.   For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will,  we shall live, and do this, or that.  But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.   (James 4:13-16)
