He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.    If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?   And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?   (Luke 16:10-12)
