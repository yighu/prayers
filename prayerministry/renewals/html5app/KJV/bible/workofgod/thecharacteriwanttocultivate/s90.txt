The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. Â And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.   (2 Samuel 23:3-4)
